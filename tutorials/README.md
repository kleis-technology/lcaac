# Tutorials

This folder contains multiple code samples covering the main LCAAC language features.
Each code sample takes the form a `.lca` file.
Use the [cli](../cli/README.md) to interact with the code.
Moreover, each code sample contains tests. You can run the tests manually, e.g.,
```bash
lcaac test -p 01-basics/01-getting-started
```

The script `run.sh` runs all the tests.
```bash
./run.sh
```
